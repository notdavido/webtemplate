  <h2>Angles and latency make a huge difference.</h2>
    <h4>Ever been confused by why your opponent's move worked? You may have a vague understanding of angles and latency, but not how to take advantage or take control in your game. This article will explain how to use angles and latency to master your peeking technique in games to see enemies before they see you. Mastery of this skill yields high competitive gains- gaming can be hard without the right foundation.</h4>
  
  <h3>Understanding Angles</h3>
  <p>Angles might seem simple at first, but they quickly become rather complex. Understanding angles can give a player a massive improvement in performance and should be considered a core mechanic. In games, more often than not, there is a line of sight from the character's head that determines what you see on your screen. We must understand that when we are in cover, our vision might be obstructed, but not anything else.</p>
    
  <p class="content">In the following images, the green ball is to represent one character, Green, while the red, Red. </p>
    
  <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/fov1.png" alt="[Image where Green does not see Red behind an obstacle]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>In this image, Green has no idea that Red is there.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/fov2.png" alt="[Image showing that Red does see Green.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>In contrast, we can see that Red can see Green quite well.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It's clear there is a relationship between the position of the characters and how much they see of the other- especially in relation to obstacles or cover- but there is a lot more we can get from this relationship.</p>
    
  <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/lines.png" alt="[Image of different perspectives from different positions]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>This time the lines represent the point at which they can last see behind the obstacle.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>As Green moves towards the obstacle, they see less, and the amount less increases with each step- meanwhile, when they move away, they see more behind the obstacle- each step moving away is worth slightly less than the one before. You can imagine it like moving a flashlight closer and farther from an object. We will now add a use for this property. I understand this image may seem complicated at first- you will likely understand better if followed along.</p>

    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/halfdrawn.png" alt="[Image of Green seeing Red until they can't from behind an obstacle.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>Red can't see Green while many of Green's positions can see a part of Red.. (Except one..)</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/onethatcantsee.png" alt="[Image of the last place Green can see Red from behind the obstacle.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>We can see clearly that Green can no longer see Red from here or any closer.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/seedifferences.png" alt="[Image showing the range of positions that can and can't see Red.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>Green has found an advantage by peeking wide.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    
    <p>The angles are important because we can imagine approaching a corner on a map and being shot before we even spot the enemy. If we approach the corner at a distance, like the green characters on the very left, we can spot the enemy before they can spot us instead. Unfortunately, not every map allows us to move as far back as we need. But at the same time, this is also a good thing. Peeking wide is not an absolute advantage. It becomes a lot more complex.</p>
    
    <h3>Understanding Latency</h3>
    <p>In this article 'latency' is not quite the same as lag, I am going to refer to latency as a delay before seeing or being seen by an opponent. Perhaps better referred to as delayed visibility if it causes any confusion.</p>
    <p>In gamin I am sure many of us know what peekers advantage is and if you do feel free to skip this paragraph. Peekers advantage is a term used to describe the latency involved when peeking. In this case, the latency is indeed caused by lag, and so the opponent has to wait for information to update while the peeking player has full information and can possibly attack the opponent before they have a chance to react. It's important to know what your advantages are since every player is able to use peekers advantage- though maybe not as optimally. [Disclaimer- This article goes over general advantages of peeking and delays and each game could handle peekers advantage differently. Fortunately, if your game has mitigated it a lot, everything else in the article should still work to theory.</p>
    
    <p>In the last images we remember Red was hidden- though not very well. We also remember how the Green could see them while the they could could not see them back. This time, the red player will be hidden better.</p>
    
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/notgoodforgreen.png" alt="[Image of Red very well hidden behind the object and Green left with no possible sight.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>Red is very well hidden now, this would be devastating for Green to peek.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>Do you remember peekers advantage? Who do you think would have the peekers advantage in this situation? Unfortunately for Green, Red has the advantage—well, maybe it's not entirely accurate to call it a complete advantage. Even though there are places where Green can see Red while Red can't see Green, it is not enough to overcome the peekers advantage, especially if Red has higher ping (and of course, specific games might handle this differently). Green wouldn't be able to make use of their angle advantage before Red's peekers advantage.</p>
    
    <p>If that wasn't bad enough, let's take a look at another disadvantage Green has. Green has no cover. Their extra distance to the cover means they need to move farther down in order to receive protection from the obstacle, whereas Red only needs to take one step. This disparity allows Red to make many mistakes while Green is vulnerable. Another issue is that Green has no easy way to peek Red as long as Red stays put and keeps cover properly. The amount of distance they would have to walk in order to maintain the angle advantage is massive—especially if they need to be wary of Red peeking at any moment, or if they do not even know if Red is there in the first place. Naturally, the further from an object a player is, the less their peekers advantage is. You can imagine a range between Red and Green.</p>
    
    
    <h3>How to apply concepts?</h3>
    <p>To use angles and latency to advantage, it's a must to know the map- and if you do not, some games provide mini-maps to look at. Like any regular skill, knowing when the advantages of peeking wide and narrow, or even in-between, come from practice. Some players may even build an intuitive understanding of some parts on some maps- though might struggle a bit more with unfamiliar territory, so the amount of hours for that would be significantly more. </p>
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/mixadvantage.png" alt="[Image with Red and Green an nuetral advantages and disadvantages.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>Neither player have a major advantage.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>In the situation shown above, Green has a slight angle advantage over Red while Red could have a slight peeking advantage. Red could be in trouble if Green attempted to slowly isolate their angle advantage while Red could move closer to increase peeking advantage.</p>
    
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/2v1red.png" alt="[Image of Red hidden while two Greens wait in position.]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>Red has come froun South and is only aware of the leftmost Green..</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>In this situation we can see clearly the map is designed for Greens side, most likely the attackers, and if Red were to attempt to utilize peekers advantage it would be a serious mistake.</p>
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/redisseen2v1.png" alt="[Image of Red having already been spotted without realizing.]" class="full-width-image">
  </figure>
    <p>And if Red is careless enough, he might even be exposing himself to the second angle he was not thinking about.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
    <p>
    Mastering angles and latency is a lengthy process and takes map knowledge and patience to develop. By understanding these concepts, you can start to leverage them to your advantage in first person games. It's important to try new things from time to time and note if you had a notable disadvantage. It's also important to know your maps and to change strategy according to any situation in a game. The more you practice, the more intuitive using these advantages will get.
